I'm an aspiring Software Engineer, Web Developer, and hobbyist Game Developer. Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at IICT, SUST. My areas of interest are Computer Simulation Modelling, Web3 based Fintech, Deep Learning, and Software and Systems Architecture.

Aside from CS stuff, I also have a keen interest in customer-driven iterative product development and managing teams. Love to observe and absorb as much knowledge as possible and apply it to my work.
